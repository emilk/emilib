# emilib
This is a loose collection of C++14 libraries I tend to reuse between different (mostly game-related) projects.

They are meant mostly for me (Emil Ernerfeldt), but if you find them useful, have at it.

Their only dependencies are either system dependencies (pthread etc) and [Loguru](https://github.com/emilk/loguru). gl_lib also depends on OpenGL and GLEW. The libraries does not depend on each other (with an exception for ShaderMngr).

They all work on OSX and iOS and probably Linux. Some may work elsewhere.

# Documentation
Documentation can be found at [https://emilk.github.io/emilib/html/index.html](https://emilk.github.io/emilib/html/index.html).


# Usage
Most libraries in emilib are stand-alone, so you can, for instance, use the coroutine library without having to compile anything but that.

Some are header-only, but most come with a `.cpp` file too.

To use a single library, just `#include` the header, and if there is a `.cpp` (or `.mm` in case of iOS/OSX) either compile and link that, or just include that too, e.g.:

	#include <emilib/coroutine.hpp>
	#include <emilib/coroutine.cpp> // Do this only in one of your .cpp files

You can also make use of `unity_build.cpp` to compile all of emilib all at once. To use the iOS/OSX specific libraries, use `unity_build.mm` instead.

You also need to compile Loguru. Luckily, `loguru.hpp` is included in this repo, and to compile it you just need to add the following to one of your .cpp files:

	#define LOGURU_IMPLEMENTATION
	#include <loguru.hpp>

Make sure you compile with -std=c++11 -lpthread -ldl

# Stand-alone libraries

#### algorithm.hpp
Useful extensions to STL

#### coroutine.hpp/.cpp
This is a "fake coroutine" class which implements a cooperative thread and methods for passing execution between the outer and inner thread.

This is really nice for handling things that you would normally use a state machine for. Perfect for games where you might want to have a scripted event, a dialogue or something else running in its own thread, but not at the same time as the main game logic thread.

#### dir_watcher.hpp/.cpp
This library allows you to watch for changes in a directory, e.g. new files, deleted files or changes in existing files. This is great for doing automatic hot-reloading of things like textures, shaders, etc.

POSIX systems only.

#### dual.hpp
Library for [dual numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number). Can be used for numerical stable differentiation. Works inside of Eigen.

#### filesystem.hpp/.cpp
Contains functions for easily reading/writing files, getting file size and modified time, listing all files in a directory, etc.

It also contains functions for working with file paths.

#### hash_cache.hpp
HashCache wraps a value and memoizes the hash of that value. Can speed up hash sets and maps by a lot.

#### hash_map.hpp / hash_set.hpp
Cache-friendly hash map/set with open addressing, linear probing and power-of-two capacity. Acts mostly like `std::unordered_map/std::unordered_set` except for:

* Much better performance
* Key/values may move when rehashing

#### irange.hpp
Simple integer range, allowing you to replace `for (size_t i = 0; i < limit; ++i)` with `for (auto i : irange(limit))`.
It also provides a `Range` class which represent an integer range in a half-closed interval [begin, end) as well as the following functions:

``` C++
	for (const auto ix : irange(end))                        { CHECK_F(0     <= ix && ix < end);           }
	for (const auto ix : irange(begin, end))                 { CHECK_F(begin <= ix && ix < end);           }
	for (const auto ix : indices(some_vector))               { CHECK_F(0 <= ix && ix < some_vector.size(); }
	for (const char ch : emilib::cstr_range("hello world!")) { ...                                         }
	for (auto& value : it_range(begin, end))                 { std::cout << value;                         }
```

#### list_map.hpp / list_set.hpp
Simple O(N) map/set with small overhead and great performance for small N.

#### magica_voxel.hpp/.cpp
Loader for [MagicaVoxel](https://voxel.codeplex.com/) models.

#### marching_squares.hpp/.cpp
Short, simple marching squares implementation.

#### mem_map.hpp/.cpp
Simple wrapper around memory mapping with RAII.

#### movement_tracker.hpp/.cpp
Track movement of some data, e.g. to estimate velocity from recent movement.
For instance, you can use this to track a finger flicking something on a touch-screen to calculate the final velocity when the finger is released.

#### read_write_mutex.hpp
Fast mutex for multiple-readers, single-writer scenarios written in pure C++11.

#### scope_exit.hpp
Adds the macro `SCOPE_EXIT` for running some code at the end of the scope (or when a function returns, etc). Example:

``` C++
void foo()
{
    File* file = fopen(...);
    SCOPE_EXIT{ fclose(file); };
    if (bar) { return; }
    if (baz) { exit(); }
    might_throw_an_exception(file);
}
```

#### string_interning.hpp/.cpp
Stupid simple thread-safe string interning.

#### strprintf.hpp/.cpp
Minimalistic string formating library. Provides two functions: `strprintf` and `vstrprintf` that act like `printf` and `vprintf` respectively, but return the formated text as a `std::string` instead of printing it.

#### tga.hpp/.cpp
Dump a tga image to disk.

#### thread_pool.hpp/.cpp
A simple thread pool.

#### timer.hpp/.cpp
Monotonic wall time chronometer.

#### tuple_util.hpp
Adds `for_each_tuple` for iterating over a `std::tuple` and also overloads `std::hash` for `std::tuple`.

#### utf8.hpp/.cpp
Really basic utf8 operations.

#### wav.hpp/.cpp
Parse WAVE (.wav) sound files.

#### word_wrap.hpp/.cpp
Wrap lines of text to fit within a given width.


# iOS / OSX specific libraries:

#### music.hpp/.mm
Stream mp3 music on OSX and iOS.

#### os.hpp/.mm
Device information like screen size and orientation.

#### pvr.hpp/.mm
Loading of compressed .pvr textures. Depends on gl_lib.

#### text_paint.hpp/.mm
Pretty multi-line Unicode text rendering for OSX and iOS. It lets you select font, size, alignment, wrapping size and allows you to colorize and italicize sub-ranges of the text.

It draws the text to memory, so it is up to you to display it (e.g. upload it to a texture).


# Libraries with third-party dependencies

#### al_lib
Code for loading, playing and positioning sounds using OpenAL.

Depends on OpenAL and other parts of emilib.

Include `al_lib.hpp` and link with `al_lib.cpp`. You can also make use of `al_lib_fwd.hpp` to bring in forward declarations for most things in al_lib.

#### gl_lib
Code for doing simple things in OpenGL and/or OpenGL ES (GLES). It has classes and methods for dealing with:

* 2D Textures
* Vertex and fragment shaders
	* You can use the same shader code for GLES and non-GLES targets
* Vertex buffers (VBO/VAO)
* Viewports
* Off-screen buffers (FBO)

Depends on OpenGL and GLEW.

Include `gl_lib.hpp` and link with `gl_lib.cpp`. You can also make use of `gl_lib_fwd.hpp` to bring in forward declarations for most things in gl_lib. To do OpenGL calls you can include `gl_lib_opengl.hpp` (which just includes the correct OpenGL and/or glew headers for you system).

#### gl_lib_sdl.hpp/.cpp
Helper functions for creating an SDL2 OpenGL window.

#### imgui_gl_lib.hpp/.cpp
Provides bindings between my `gl_lib` and the wonderful [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) GUI library. Can be used alone or together with `emilib/imgui_sdl.hpp/.cpp`.

#### imgui_gl_lib_tools.hpp/.cpp
Some additional helpers for painting OpenGL stuff with `gl_lib` inside of [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

#### imgui_helpers.hpp/.cpp
Helpers for working with the wonderful [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) GUI library.

#### imgui_sdl.hpp/.cpp
Bindings between [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and the wonderful [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) GUI library. Can be used alone or together with `emilib/imgui_gl_lib.hpp/.cpp`.

#### sdl_input.hpp/.cpp
sdl_input wraps the input events from [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) with an easy-to-use interface that is unified for desktop and mobile.

#### shader_mngr.hpp/.cpp
This is NOT a stand-alone library, but depends on other parts of emilib as well as loguru and configuru.
ShaderMngr's job is to encapsulate loading, memoization and reloading of shader files.
In particular, ShaderMngr can detect changes in .shader files and automatically reload (hot-reloading) them.

#### texture_mngr.hpp/.cpp
This is NOT a stand-alone library, but depends on other parts of emilib as well as loguru.
TextureMngr's job is to encapsulate loading, memoization and reloading of texture files.
In particular, TextureMngr can detect changes in image files and automatically reload (hot-reloading) them.
